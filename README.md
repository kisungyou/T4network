**T4network** is an **R** package for network analysis. It is not aimed
at replacing well-established software. Rather, it focuses on delivering
a number of algorithms that are not available from those.

## Installation

You can install the released version of T4network from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("T4network")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kisungyou/T4network")
```
